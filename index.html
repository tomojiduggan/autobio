                <h1>Welcome to my autobiography!</h1>
                <p>My name is Tomoji, and I wish to be a programmer. 
                    I have varied experience with front-end development with languages including HTML, CSS, Javascript. 
                    I also have experience using extensions such as React, Bootstrap, SCSS, and a few more minor frameworks.
                    I have developed basic skills in Adobe Illustrate and Adobe Photoshop, which occasionaly comes in handy within Web Development.
                    More recently, I have developed a fondness for Python and Artificial Intelligence and have experimented with applications of stable-diffusion models.
                    I am currently finishing up my Cegep degree at Cegep Heritage College and have been accepted at Mcgill in physics.
                    I am planning on taking an honours physics and computer science joint major.

                    On my free time, I do karate, I play violin and I code.</p>
