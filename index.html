                <h1>Tomoji Duggan</h1>
                <p>A young aspiring scientist and programmer. 
                    I have varied experience with front-end development with languages including HTML, CSS, Javascript. 
                    I also have experience using extensions such as React, Bootstrap, SCSS, and a few more minor frameworks.
                    I have developed basic skills in Adobe Illustrate and Adobe Photoshop, which occasionaly comes in handy within Web Development.
                    More recently, I have developed a fondness for Python and Artificial Intelligence and have experimented with applications of stable-diffusion models.
                    I am currently finishing up my Cegep degree at Cegep Heritage College and have been accepted at Mcgill in physics.
                    I am planning on taking an honours physics and computer science joint major.

                    On my free time, I do karate, I play violin and I code.</p>

                                    La Pointe-aux-Jeunes is a government-subsidized organization with the goal of providing a place of belonging that allows young people to be artisans of their projects and realize their full potential. During the summer, we offered bike initiations for young people with the help of a bike trailer, we did animation in the parks and much more! This developed my communication and my self-confidence due to a variety of proposals and presentations that I made in front of several colleagues or young people. I also helped some of my colleagues with technical issues regarding computer programs and file organization.

                                    Tim Hortons is a fast food chain that mainly sells coffee, pastries, and sandwiches. During my shifts at this place, I have learnt how to prepare beverages, memorizing orders and bring the proper pastries in a high-stress environment. Also, I have taken many orders in both English and French and I have handled cash registers before. After about a year of working there, I have learnt how to bake various pastries and was offered a supervisor position.

                                This is my personal project that I did as required by my International program at Grande-Rivière. 
                                It consisted of a real part, which was to make an improvised aquaponics system, and a website which presents my research and experience.
                                For this project, I used React, which made me learn a new framework although not practical for small-scale sites.
                                During the making of this website, I have learnt alot about neat things that can be implemented within websites to make it more interesting.
                                I also learnt how to use Adobe Illustrate, which was used to make the diagram in the Explanation part.<br/><br/>
